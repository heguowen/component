\b0 \cf0 \
\pard
\cf0 Release 4 (beta 1) of the OS X Font Tools requires OS X 10.6 or later; 10.7 is recommended.\
\
Make sure you have the latest version of OS X and other Apple software. Choose Software Update from the Apple Menu, and install any recommended updates.\
\

\'95 A new source file format for 'morx' and 'just' tables\
\

\b Command-line Utilities\

\b0 \
The core of the OS X Font Tools is a set of command-line utilities which are installed via the OS X Font Tool installer.  This installer also includes two command-line utilities for developing keyboards on OS X: klcompile and kluchrtoxml.  klcompiler compiles XML-style keyboard layouts and lets you find errors in them before they are installed.  kluchrtoxml converts old keyboard resources to XML.\
\
The installer is set up so that the font tools and keyboard tools may be installed separately.  \
\
The command-line utilities are installed in /usr/bin. They presuppose some familiarity with using the Terminal application and the Unix shell. \
\

\b The Font Toolbox Framework\

\b0 \
The OS X Font Tools installer will also install a new framework, the Font Toolbox framework, that is not part of the OS X system. This framework is not intended for use by applications or tools other than the OS X Font Tools. It is required by most of the font tools and should not be deleted.\
\
The installer will place this framework in /Library/Frameworks, but you are free to move it to ~/Library/Frameworks.\
\

\b Applications\

\b0 \
There are also three applications included: Blinker, FontProoferX, and MorxTester.  These can be drag installed.  \
\

\b Documentation\

\b0 \
Documentation for the OS X Font Tools is included.  The documentation may not always cover the full functionality of each tool.  The most current documentation for the Unix command-line utilities is available by executing them with the -h or --help option (for help).  \
\
Apple's version of the TrueType specification is included for convenience.  The latest version is available on-line at <http://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/index.html>.  \
